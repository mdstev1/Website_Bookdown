<h1><span class="header-section-number">Chapter 3</span> Literature Review</h1>
<p>Correctly characterizing groundwater levels and storage in an aquifer can be very difficult without a robust dataset. Often, in-situ data are collected at inconsistent intervals, while wells and monitoring stations are rarely distributed evenly. Because groundwater depends on so many different factors and does not exhibit linear behavior, finding ways to estimate groundwater levels without a complete set of in-situ data becomes a very important task. Some of these methods will be discussed here.</p>
<p>Many of these methods utilize remote sensing data to analyze groundwater levels. A study performed by <span class="citation">Thomas et al. (<a href="#ref-THOMAS2017384" role="doc-biblioref">2017</a>)</span> utilizes data from NASA’s Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission to determine changes in groundwater. Satellites measure the changes in Earth’s gravitational field, due to changes in mass distribution, which can measure the redistribution of water. The study normalizes data collected by GRACE to measure changes in groundwater due to drought, which they call the GRACE Groundwater Drought Index (GGDI). Many measures can only account for climatological factors, but the GGDI is able to capture anthropogenic effects as well. This important for groundwater, which is often subjected to increased pumping during droughts. The method demonstrated an effective way to utilize remotely sensed data across a large area to measure groundwater response. However, the authors note that, due to GRACE’s temporal resolution, the GGDI can only be used with confidence to determine droughts after 3 months of indicated drought.</p>
<p>There are other methods to utilize remotely sensed data to characterize groundwater. <span class="citation">Sneed (<a href="#ref-piahs-372-23-2015" role="doc-biblioref">2015</a>)</span> used remotely sensed data to track land subsidence during 2007-2014 of over 0.5 m in the San Joaquin Valley (which falls within the Central Valley of California). Land surface depressions were determined using Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) and in-situ data from extensometers and Continuous Global Positioning System (CGPS) data. This increase in subsidence coincided with an increase in groundwater pumping, due to drought. These findings agree with a study performed by <span class="citation">Vasco (<a href="#ref-Vasco-2019" role="doc-biblioref">2019</a>)</span>, which analyzed a drop in vertical land surface in the Central Valley during 2015-2018, also observed using InSAR data. Their estimated decrease in groundwater storage in the Tulare basin was similar to other independent estimates, including that of the GRACE mission, another remote sensing data source. This provides reasonable assurances on the accuracy of the method for this area. These findings show promise for the efficacy of using remotely sensed data to measure changes in groundwater levels in the Central Valley.</p>
<p>Another method for estimating groundwater levels is interpolating measurements based on in-situ data. Since many wells lack consistent and continuous measurements, statistical machine learning methods can be used to fill in these gaps. One such method is the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM), which was described by <span class="citation">Huang, Zhu, and Siew (<a href="#ref-HUANG-2006" role="doc-biblioref">2006</a>)</span>. The ELM is a type of machine learning that can map nonlinear relationships between input data sources. These correlations can then be used to determine missing values in one of the data sources. The ELM method was demonstrated to have a very fast learning time and is flexible to use in many different applications. This particular study has been cited over 7000 times. If the method can be demonstrably more effective and accurate than other methods of data imputation in a groundwater application, it could prove to be a very useful tool.</p>
<p>This ELM method was demonstrated in a groundwater application in a recent study by <span class="citation">Evans (<a href="#ref-Evans-2019" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span>. They demonstrated a method to impute temporal gaps in groundwater data using remotely sensed Earth observation data and the in-situ data as the input datasets. Earth observation data sources included two soil moisture models: the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) model and the NOAA Climate Prediction Center (CPC) model. It also included the Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI). The ELM was applied well-by-well and observed correlations between the groundwater level measurements from each well and the Earth observation data. This correlation was then used to interpolate data points during temporal ranges that had no data. The method was chosen due to its ability to function without a large amount of in-situ data to “train” the model, which is common among groundwater datasets. To demonstrate its effectiveness, the method was applied to two areas in Utah. The results obtained by the Earth observation method utilizing ELM were significantly more accurate than Kriging (a form a spatial interpolation) in areas of relatively consistent human influences (changes in groundwater pumping, land use changes, etc.). This method provides a more accurate and flexible method to impute groundwater data, which could be very helpful in areas with limited or especially sporadic groundwater data. However, only two areas were analyzed in the paper, demonstrating the need for further testing.</p>
<p>The Central Valley of California is one of the most productive agricultural areas in the United States. The area produces approximately $17 billion in agronomic value per year and a quarter of the nation’s food (<span class="citation">USGS (<a href="#ref-usgs" role="doc-biblioref">n.d.</a>)</span>). However, due to the dry climate that it sits in, farms in the valley rely heavily on groundwater. In fact, it is the 2nd most-pumped aquifer system in the country, according to the United States Geological Survey (USGS). In fact, groundwater levels in the valley are reaching historically low levels (<span class="citation">Thomas et al. (<a href="#ref-THOMAS2017384" role="doc-biblioref">2017</a>)</span>). Over pumping of aquifers can lead to severe consequences to both people and property through subsidence and can lead to long-term and even permanent changes in hydrologic and aquifer patterns. Due to this extreme amount of groundwater extraction in the area and the resultant threats, regulation now requires more sustainable use of groundwater in the region. Due to the wealth of groundwater data in the area, it is a perfect candidate for testing of groundwater interpolation methods.</p>
<p>A recent study performed by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory at the California Institute of Technology recently performed a study that compiled all freely available groundwater data in the area from different sources and synthesized it. Data were collected from 5 different sources across two different agencies: the USGS and the California Department of Water Resources (DWR). They eliminated duplicates and invalid data, then used a scoring method to select wells that were evenly distributed and had an appropriately large and consistent set of observations. This study has not yet been published, and so will not be cited in this work. However, this dataset was shared with the author’s research group at BYU and will be used as the base for this study.</p>
