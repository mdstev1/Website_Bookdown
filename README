    Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) from NCAR
    
    Note: there is an a newer file available: the self-calibrated PDSI from
    1850 to 2014. The dataset has been updated and past values reanalyzed.

    Detailed Description:
    
    * PDSI from the Dai dataset. The Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI)
    is devised by Palmer (1965) to represent the severity of dry and
    wet spells over the U.S. based on monthly temperature and
    precipitation data as well as the soil-water holding capacity at
    that location. These data consist of the monthly PDSI over global
    land areas from 1850 to 2010. Different precipitation/temperature
    datasets are used in the different files. Update and more
    information are available at CGD (Climate and Global Dynamics
    Division).
    Please let the author, Dai at adai@ucar.edu, know what you are
    using the dataset for.

    * Please note: If you acquire Dai Palmer Drought Severity Index data
    products from PSL, we ask that you acknowledge us in your use of
    the data. This may be done by including text such as Dai Palmer
    Drought Severity Index data provided by the NOAA/OAR/ESRL PSL,
    Boulder, Colorado, USA, from their Web site at
    http://psl.noaa.gov/ in any documents or publications
    using these data. We would also appreciate receiving a copy of the
    relevant publications. This will help PSL to justify keeping the
    Dai Palmer Drought Severity Index data set freely available online
    in the future. Thank you!
