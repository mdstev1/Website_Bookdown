This repository houses the code for a report hosted in a bookdown website hosted at https://mdstev1.github.io/Website_Bookdown/ by Michael Stevens. It was created to fulfill the requirements for a term project for CE En 594R, Data Science for Engineers at Brigham Young University. The project is written primarily in R.

The report explores a dataset from NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) in California. The dataset includes compiled groundwater level data in the central valley of California from 2001-2019. Two groundwater imputation methods are used and compared in the report using the dataset.

The following R packages will need to be installed. However, the code will run these packages automatically, so the user will not need to download them.
* dplyr
